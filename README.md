💻 How to Run the Project
Open the file covid_analysis.ipynb using Jupyter Notebook, VS Code, or Google Colab.

Run all the cells sequentially to:

Load and clean the data

Visualize COVID-19 trends

Train machine learning models

Make predictions

📊 Sample Visualization Code
python
Copy
Edit
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Load dataset
df = pd.read_csv("data/covid_data.csv")
df['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Date'])

# Filter for top 5 affected states
top_states = ['Maharashtra', 'Karnataka', 'Kerala', 'Tamil Nadu', 'Uttar Pradesh']
filtered_df = df[df['State/UnionTerritory'].isin(top_states)]

# Line plot
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
sns.lineplot(data=filtered_df, x="Date", y="Active_Cases", hue="State/UnionTerritory")
plt.title("Top 5 Affected States in India")
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
🤖 Machine Learning Section
You will also find code to train ML models using scikit-learn such as:

Linear Regression

Decision Trees

Random Forests

Example Snippet:
python
Copy
Edit
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

X = df[['Day_Count']]  # Feature
y = df['Active_Cases']  # Target

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

predictions = model.predict(X_test)
